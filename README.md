# ops201d6-code-challenges

## What is this repo all about?

This repo contains a series of code challenges I was assigned during my time at Code Fellows attending the course "Ops 201". Enjoy!

## Why am I learning these skills?

I am learning the skill of scripting for a few reasons. Scripting allows one to automate routine tasks, such as vulnerability scanning and system administration. It also allows for a more rapid response to a security incident such as malicious files and running processes. 

## What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

The concepts I learned in the Ops 201 course include using the Command Line Interface (or "Terminal"), Git, Developer Tools, Troubleshooting Techniques, Windows Security, Registry, and Event Viewer, Data Restoration, Repair, and Disposal, Configuring pfSense, Cloud Virtualization with AWS, and Malware Remediation. 

## What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

My favorite challenge was Ops Challenege twelve using the Select-String command, giving you even more control of what the computer outputs.

## How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

Automating routine tasks: Shell scripts can be used to automate routine tasks such as log analysis, system updates, backups, and file transfers, freeing up time for cybersecurity professionals to focus on more critical tasks.

System hardening: Shell scripts can be used to configure and harden operating systems and applications to reduce the attack surface and mitigate known vulnerabilities.

Incident response: Shell scripts can be used to quickly identify, isolate, and contain security incidents by automating the execution of incident response procedures.

Penetration testing: Shell scripts can be used to develop custom tools for penetration testing, such as port scanners, vulnerability scanners, and password crackers.

Data analysis: Shell scripts can be used to analyze data from log files, network traffic, and other sources to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Network security: Shell scripts can be used to monitor network traffic, configure firewalls and VPNs, and detect and block malicious traffic.

## What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

I would like to continue improving my overall skill of scripting and study it in my free time.

## What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

I hope to improve my ability to use shell scripting to automate tasks next.
